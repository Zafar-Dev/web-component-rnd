This is a React web component library project that creates reusable widgets with Shadow DOM encapsulation. The components are designed to be framework-agnostic while being built with React.

## Project Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Implement Shadow DOM for true encapsulation
- Export components that can be used in React, Next.js, and other frameworks
- Follow modern React patterns with hooks
- Ensure components are fully self-contained with their own styling
- Use proper event handling and prop passing for interoperability
- Build components as npm packages for easy distribution
- Include comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Ensure components work both as React components and as custom elements
